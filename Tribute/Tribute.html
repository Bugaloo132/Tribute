                Leonardo was born on April 15, 1452, "at the third hour of the night" in the Tuscan hill town of Vinci,
                in the lower valley of the Arno River in the territory of Florence.

                At the age of fourteen, Leonardo was apprenticed to one of the most successful artists of his day,
                Andrea di Cione, known as Verrocchio.

                The angel holds a Madonna lily, a symbol of Mary's virginity
                and of the city of Florence. It is supposed that Leonardo originally copied the wings from those of a
                bird in flight, but they have since been lengthened by a later artist. The marble table, in front of the
                Virgin, probably quotes the tomb of Piero and Giovanni de' Medici in the Basilica of San Lorenzo,
                Florence, which Verrocchio had sculpted during this same period.

                . Ginevra de' Benci (Born 1457) was a lady of
                the aristocratic class in 15th century Florence, admired for her intelligence by Florentine
                contemporaries.

                She is the subject of one of only about 17 existing paintings attributed to Leonardo da Vinci. The
                oil-on-wood portrait was permanently acquired by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., USA,
                in 1967 for US$5 million paid to the Princely House of Liechtenstein, a record price at the time. This
                portrait is currently the only painting by Leonardo in the Americas.
